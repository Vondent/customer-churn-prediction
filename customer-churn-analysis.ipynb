    "## Introduction: Predicting Customer Churn in Subscription-Based Services\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, monthly subscription-based services have surged in popularity, spanning industries such as streaming (e.g., Netflix, Spotify), SaaS (Software as a Service), fitness (e.g., Peloton), and e-commerce (e.g., Amazon Prime). These models offer convenience and consistent revenue streams, making them an attractive business strategy. However, they also introduce a critical metric to monitor: **customer churn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Churn**: refers to the percentage of customers who cancel or stop renewing their subcriptions during a given time period.  High churn rates can significantlyt impact revenue and long-term growth, especially in competitive markets wjere acquiring new customers is often more expenstive then retaining existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate churn and retain consumers, we can implement strategies such as:\n",
    "- Personalized offers and retention campaigns\n",
    "- Improving onboarding and customer support\n",
    "- Monitoring engagement metrics to intervene before customers churn\n",
    "\n",
    "To stay ahead of potential losses, we can utilize data-driven churn prediction models that help us act proactively rather than reactively. These models analyze customer behavior and identify individuals who are at a high risk of leaving, allowing companies to intervene before it’s too late. Common machine learning approaches used for predicting churn include:\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable baseline model for binary classification\n",
    "- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Useful for capturing nonlinear patterns and feature importance\n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting Machines**: Models such as XGBoost and LightGBM are power ensemble methods with strong predictive performance\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**: Applied for complex. high-dimensional data scenarios\n",
    "- **Survival Analysis**: Useful when modeling when a customer will churn, not just if.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical subscription and behavioral data introduced below. This prediction can empower businesses to make informed decisions that reduce churn and enhance customer lifetime value."
